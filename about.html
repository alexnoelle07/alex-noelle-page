          I am a native San Franciscan currently working as a preschool teacher at 
          Genentech's 2nd Generation. I have my B.S. in Early Childhood Development 
          from CSU East Bay. I have spent the past 10 years working with children and 
          being a part of their growth and development. 
          <br>
          <br>
          With the pandemic's affect on schools and education, I was able to see a 
          first-hand experience what distance learning looked like from the perspective of 
          a child within the early-age range. I saw this as an opportunity to seek out a 
          program that would teach me what I needed to help younger children successfully learn
          core concepts. I was able to find SheCodes and start my coding journey!

          <div class="col about-me">
        <p>
          My other hobbies include photography. I mostly take family portraits but I 
          have been doing more projects such as weddings and company photos. I love creative 
          outlets and expressing that through many forms. With developers continuing
          to be in demand, I found it the perfect way to make a career change while still utilizing
          having a creative perspective on future projects.
          <br>
          <br>
          So far I have built some basic web pages and a weather app. I have been enjoying 
          every part of this learning experience and I encourage anyone who is thinking about joining 
          this community to do so! I can't wait to see what I will create next with SheCodes!
